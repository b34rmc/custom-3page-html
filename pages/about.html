            Devpipeline is here to change peoples lives and fill the GAP. What
            does that mean? Well the GAP is unemployed software developers. In
            the first page we went over why they are unemployed and now we'll
            talk about how DevPipelines filling the gap. At Devpipeline they are
            focused on 3 main sections, each section is 15 weeks long. The first
            section is Coding Foundations. In this part of the course they teach
            you the basic skills and fundamentals of programming. This builds a
            <strong>strong</strong>
            foundation allowing you to be able to switch and learn new languages
            in a fraction of the time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After the first 15 weeks you start working part time. This allows
            you to start getting real world work experience while learning. your
            schedule changes from 8-12 class to 8-12 work and 1-5 class. during
            the second part your now enrolled in the front-end course. This is
            where you learn the fundamentals of web development. By the end of
            this next 15 weeks you will be able to program in react and be able
            to spin up fully functional websites in no time!

            The third 15 weeks is the Back-end course. This is where you learn
            how to verify users, Create users, and much more that's handled on
            the back end. This is what makes your apps, web logins and all that
