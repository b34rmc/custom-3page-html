            Let's start by what devpipeline isn't. Devpipeline isn't a bootcamp.
            Bootcamps are a 12 week course that cost around 12-15 thousand
            dollars. In those 12 weeks they Plan to make you a production ready
            developer. Unfortunatly, 12 weeks just isn't enough to be a
            production ready developer. 12 weeks is just enough time to get a
            grasp on the basics. You've made a few programs at this point and
            are feeling more competent in your developing abilities. Although
            your feeling more confident you still don't feel anywhere near
            capable of getting a job. There's a reason for that, It's because
            you're not. That's why people out of bootcamps have a very low
            success rate for getting jobs. Most of the time they are doing
            freelance work trying to build up a resume.
          </p>

            Devpipeline is also not a college. Colleges are 4 years for software
            development. The people who come out of college have the skills they
            need to get a job and are competent developers and ready for the
            field. Theres just one problem, they don't have a high success rate
            getting jobs either. Why's that? Because they don't have any on the
            job experience. So what does DevPipeline do different? Click here to
